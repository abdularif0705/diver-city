![Diversity Game Photo](https://github.com/ramosbe/diver-city/blob/master/img/divercity-game.png)
> Diver-City is building a 2D platformer-type video game. We chose this as our
> project because we think it will be fun and within our abilities. We strongly believe this will
> leverage our understanding of both the Unity platform and the C# language.
